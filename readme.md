# Malware neural network
## Basic idea release
Classifies a binary as malware or not malware by converting the binary to a grayscale image and running it through a CNN. The dataset can be made from the zoo and system binaries. A replicated project but [jmcs811](github.com/jmcs811) and I wanted to play around with some ideas.
